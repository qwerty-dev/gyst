gyst
==========


Average day consists of 6 to 8 tasks. Everyone needs to take care of business, but some things get forgotten. With gyst, people you know won't let you forget anything ever again. Here is how it works: You add a person to a 'circle' you created and by creating tasks in that circle you allow that person to see your tasks. When your task is 30min due all people in this taks's circle will get an ability to remind you (email+sms). Here is a situation: I need to go to court in the morning and I need to take all the nessasary documents with me. gyst will send me reminders so I won't forget anything + my friends would know what I am doing throught the day and also that my mood is not great because who the hell enjoyes going to court in the morning?! (lawyer joke). You can call me after, see how I did with my task and show that you care.

index page will show all the taks in 24hr period, so you can see who is doing what and what their average day is like. Show care, remind.
